DataONE CN Index Common Lib
------------------------

This library provides the index task item data model along with JPA and spring-data configuration to create
a IndexTask repository providing persistance and query functionality.

The repository can be configured to use either a postgres or hql datasource by modifying the configuration in
task-index-context.xml.  This file imports a spring context file called postgres-datasource.xml.  Change this
configuration to use the provided hsql-datasource.xml for in-memory database instead.

The jdbc.properties file contains default configuration parameters required for the datasource, for local
testing.  This property file is not imported in task-index-context.xml but rather left for 'consummer's of
the repository to provide the path for this configuration.  In production, this configuration will be external
to the component installation for easier configuration.  

See text-context.xml for an example of including and 
configuring the datasource for test run-time

See the test classes under src/test for example usage.

See LICENSE.txt for the details of distributing this software.
